This repository contains the technical paper as well the powerpoint presentation detailing the development of a 12x12 bit multiplier using the Dadda architecture and it's subsequent comaprisons with other architectures in the categories of speed, accuracy, area occupied and power consumption. The documents contain a step by step explanation of the multiple stages designed and the logic behind the multiplier's operation. Simulation results are also provided for the aforementioned criteria.
